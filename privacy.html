    <h1>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
    <h3>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
    <p>When you browse Daily JavaScript, we also automatically receive your computerâ€™s internet protocol (IP)
      address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system. We
      also collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.</p>
    <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
    <p>How do you get my consent?</p>
    <p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, we imply that you consent to our
      collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
    <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you
      directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
    <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
    <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the
      continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at
      support@dailyjavascript.io</p>
    <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of
      Service.</p>
    <h3>SECTION 4 - PAYMENT</h3>
    <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
      Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p>
    <p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service
      providers.</p>
    <h3>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>
    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
      extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
    <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
      processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them
      for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
    <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in
      which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
    <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a
      different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the
      services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
      jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
    <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in
      the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to
      disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
    <h3>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h3>
    <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to
      make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
    <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
      technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
      electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally
      accepted industry standards.</p>
    <h3>SECTION 7 - AGE OF CONSENT</h3>
    <p>By using this site, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of
      residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us
      your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.</p>
    <h3>SECTION 8 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

      clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to
      this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we
      collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.</p>
